=======================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/alexilyaev/alfred-workflow-github.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/alexilyaev/alfred-workflow-github)

> [Alfred 3](https://www.alfredapp.com/) workflow to search for stuff on GitHub.

This is an experiment, for now
-------------------------------

I was using another workflow but it was slow and I was wondering if I could create a workflow on my own.  
So I"ve decided to experiment and found [Alfy](https://github.com/sindresorhus/alfy), then decided
to try the GitHub v4 API (based on GraphQL), and so this happened.  
This workflow **is not** faster than the other solutions, I think it's GitHub's API speed, but it's
written in JavaScript ðŸ˜€.

For now, check ou the [Existing Solutions](https://github.com/alexilyaev/alfred-workflow-github/wiki/Existing-Solutions)
